## Neurocognitive Modelling of Decision Confidence 

This repository has some of the analyses I conducted for my master's thesis at KU Leuven, under the supervision of [Kobe Desender](https://desenderlab.com/kobe-desender/) and [Michael D. Nunez](https://www.ampl-psych.com/team/michael-d-nunez/). 

I presented this project at the 2024 Society for Mathematical Psychology conference. You can find the abstract [here](https://mathpsych.org/presentation/1388#/abstract).
